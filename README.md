# CS373-Movies-Project
Project for CS373 Introduction to Machine Learning

## Movies Project
For our project, we used a dataset containing user’s movie reviews. Each entry contains the user’s unique ID, the movie’s unique ID, and the rating the user gave the movie (1-5). Our goal was to be able to predict whether a given user will like the movie Forrest Gump based off their reviews of other movies. We chose Forrest Gump because it had the most reviews in our dataset. We used perceptron as well as perceptron with myopic forward fitting as our machine learning algorithms.
